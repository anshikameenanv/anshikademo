    <h2>Types of Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small pieces of text sent as files to your computer or mobile
      device when you visit most websites. Cookies may be delivered by us (first
      party cookies) or delivered by a third-party partner or supplier
      (third-party cookies). Cookies are either session cookies or persistent
      cookies. Session cookies enable sites to recognize and link the actions of
      a user during a browsing session and expire at the end of each session.
      Persistent cookies help us recognize you as an existing user and these
      cookies are stored on your system or device until they expire, although
      you can delete them before the expiration date.
    </p>
    <h2>Other Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      <b>· Web beacons, gifs,</b> and clear gifs are tiny graphics, each with a
      unique identifier that are embedded invisibly on sites and in emails. Web
      beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited or if ad banners on
      our sites and other sites are effective. We also use web beacons in our
      HTML-based emails to let us know whether our emails have been opened by
      recipients, which helps us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
      communications, promotions, and marketing campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>· Proximity based beacons</b> send one-way signals over very short
      distances, to communicate with associated mobile apps installed on your
      phone. They can notify you, for example, about experiences related to your
      trip and can alert you to related deals or promotions. Beacons communicate
      with your device only when you are in close proximity and only if you have
      given consent within the relevant mobile application.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>· Pixels</b> are small objects embedded into a web page that are not
      visible to the user. We use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer,
      facilitate the log-in process, monitor the activity on our sites, and
      deliver online advertising.
    </p>
    <P>
      <b>· Tags</b> are small pieces of HTML code that tell your browser to
      request certain content generated by an ad server. We use tags to show you
      relevant advertising and promotions.
    </P>
    <p>
      <b>· Scripts </b>are pieces of JavaScript code that launch automatically
      when certain webpages load, to determine whether users view associated
      advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>· Local Storage Objects</b>, such as HTML 5, are used to store content
      and preferences. Third-parties with whom we partner to provide certain
      features on our site to display advertising based upon your web browsing
      activity use Local Storage Objects to collect and store information.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the technologies described above will be collectively referred to
      in this Cookie Statement as “cookies”.
